I'm a software architect at [Atos Unify](https://unify.com/en/). More about my professional life on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/). Over the years, with the help of my colleagues, we were granted
[a few patents](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1ZmDvYAAAAJ&hl=en).

In December of 2020 I completed a Computer Science master's degree at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/),
focusing on machine learning. The thesis is available [here](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).

I'm now a Ph.D. candidate, focusing on machine learning, continuing the work I did for the master's degree. My projects for the master's and the Ph.D. are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

### Publications from the master's and Ph.D. work

- [Master's thesis](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).
- [Dataset datasheet for CheXpert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03020), in collaboration with the [Stanford CheXpert team](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/).
- IEEE ICMLA data science tutorial [notebooks](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/ieee-icmla-2019-data-science-tutorial) (the practical part of [Dr. Marques'](https://www.ogemarques.com/) [The Data Science landscape: foundations, tools, and practical applications](https://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla19/links/tutorialAM.htm)).
- [Dropout vs. batch normalization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9). The free version of the paper is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PyRUgSXqpl_OvJkWrR4HCWLDaEexzWd9/view) and the code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap6619-deep-learning-term-project).
- Code for assignments and blog posts is [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

### Older things

I used to be more active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/336802/christian-garbin). Nowadays I help a bit with questions and answers moderation.

At around the same time, I wrote about more technical topics [on Blogger](https://christiangarbin.blogspot.com/). I switched to GitHub Pages (this blog) to simplify my workflows because most of my work is already on GitHub.
