<p>I’m a software architect at <a href="https://unify.com/en/">Atos Unify</a>. More about me in
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, with the help of my colleagues, we were granted
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1ZmDvYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a few patents</a>.</p>

<p>In December of 2020 I completed a Computer Science master’s degree at <a href="https://www.fau.edu/">Florida Atlantic University</a>,
focusing on machine learning. The work I did for the master’s is <a href="https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin">collected here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap6619-deep-learning-term-project">dropout vs. batch normalization term project</a>
became a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9">peer-reviewed paper</a>
(with much help from the professors listed as co-authors). The free version of the paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PyRUgSXqpl_OvJkWrR4HCWLDaEexzWd9/view">available here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m now a Ph.D. candidate, also focusing on machine learning, continuing the work I did for the master’s degree.</p>
