I'm a software architect at [Atos Unify](https://unify.com/en/). More about me in
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/).

Over the years, with the help of my colleagues, we were granted
[a few patents](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1ZmDvYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I'm finishing my Computer Science master's at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/),
focusing on machine learning.

The work I did for the master's is [collected here](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

The [dropout vs. batch normalization term project](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap6619-deep-learning-term-project)
became a [peer-reviewed paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9)
(with much help from the professors listed as co-authors).

I will start the Ph.D. program in 2021, also in machine learning.
