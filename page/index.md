title: "Why use Tufte's theme?"
---

I picked this Jekyll theme because I admire the work of [Edward Tutfe](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/).

One thing the particularly annoys me when reading papers and books, are references that switch context. They force you to go to the bottom of the page or, even worse, to some later section of the paper or book.

Tufte, on the other hand, puts the references right where they belong, with the text that refers to them{% sidenote "note-1" "Like this example of a reference, right next to the text that refers to it." %}.

Adding margin figures is another great feature. For example, when discussing Charles Minard's visualization of [Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard), we can add a picture next to (this) paragraph to illustrate it {% marginfigure "margin-figure-id" "assets/img/napoleons-march.png" "Minard's Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812" %}.
