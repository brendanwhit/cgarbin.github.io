I'm a software architect at [Atos Unify](https://unify.com/en/). More about my professional life on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/). Over the years, with the help of my colleagues, we were granted
[a few patents](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1ZmDvYAAAAJ&hl=en).

In December of 2020 I completed a Computer Science master's degree at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/),
focusing on machine learning. The thesis is available [here](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).

I'm now a Ph.D. candidate, also focusing on machine learning, continuing the work I did for the master's degree.

The projects I did for the master's and the Ph.D are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

Publications from the master's and Ph.D. work:

- My [master's thesis](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).
- [Dropout vs. batch normalization](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap6619-deep-learning-term-project)
started as a class project and was eventually published as a [peer-reviewed paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9)
(with much help from the professors listed as co-authors). The free version of the paper is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PyRUgSXqpl_OvJkWrR4HCWLDaEexzWd9/view).
- In collaboration with the [Stanford CheXpert team](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/), we created a [dataset datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) for CheXPert and published it [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03020).
